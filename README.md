# qBittorrent nord theme

This is a nord theme for qBittorrent based on the [nord colour palette](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and is a fork of [Mahdi Mirzade's themes](https://github.com/mahdimirzade/qbittorrent) with only the colours changed.

## Installation

The theme can be installed by downloading the `nord.qbtheme` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/booth-w/qbittorrent-nord-theme/releases) and importing it into qBittorrent.

The qbtheme file can also be compiled with `rcc nord.qrc -o nord.qbtheme --binary`.

In qBittorrent, go to `Tools` -> `Preferences` -> `Behaviour` -> `Interface` -> `UI Theme file` and select the `nord.qbtheme` file.
